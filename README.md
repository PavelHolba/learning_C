# Learning C language
This is my attempt to learn basics of C language from scratch.

## Lesson1
Creating simple HelloWorld program, to demonstrate printf command and how to comment in the code.
Compile with `gcc -o operators operators.c`.

## Lesson2
Simple program demonstrating varios types of variables and how to print them.
Compile with `gcc -o operators operators.c`.

## Lesson3
Goal of the program is to ask user for two numbers and demonstrate binary operations on them.
Compile with `gcc -o operators operators.c -lm`.
